        <h2>Plot</h2>
        <p>
          Dear Zindagi tells the story of Kaira, a young cinematographer struggling with relationships,
          career pressure, and emotional baggage. The film explores mental health in a gentle and
          relatable way, showing that it’s okay to seek help and take time to understand yourself.

        <h2>Characters</h2>
        <p>
          Alia Bhatt delivers a natural and heartfelt performance as Kaira.
          Shah Rukh Khan, as Dr. Jehangir Khan, plays a calm and thoughtful therapist
          who guides her without judgment. The supporting characters feel realistic
          and add depth to the narrative.

        <h2>Visuals</h2>
        <p>
          The visuals are soothing and beautifully shot, especially the scenes set in Goa.
          Soft colors, natural lighting, and peaceful locations perfectly match the film’s
          emotional tone and reflective mood.

      <section id="verdict">
        <h2>My Verdict</h2>
        <p>
          Dear Zindagi is a warm, comforting film that feels like a conversation rather than a lecture.
          It encourages self-love, emotional honesty, and mental well-being.
